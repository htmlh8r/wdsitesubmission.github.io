            <img src="images/horse_1.jpg" alt="Really sad looking horse we are trying to get rid of" class="round">
            <p>Scrawny Nag is our first horse and man o' man has this poor girl seen better days. In fact we will pay you to take the poor girl off our hands, we just wanna see her go to a good home because we need more space on the ranch for new better horses to sell. We love her but she's sadly gotta go.</p>

            <h3>Norm the Horse   <span class="action">3,000$</span></h3>
            <img src="images/horse_2.jpg" alt="Normal looking horse" class="round">
            <p>Norm is a solid and very normal horse. There is nothing wrong with Norm we swear. We've had people in the past come in a meet Norm and they all agree that he is in fact VERY NORMAL, and that he has never looked at anyone in a wierd way or even stalked them or ANYTHING like that. This is because Norm is a normal well behaved horse and he can be yours for the normal horse price of 3,000 horse dollars.</p>

            <h3>Equus Caballus 9000   <span class="action">10,000$</span></h3>
            <img src="images/horse_3.jpg" alt="MOST EXPENSIVE HORSE" class="round">
            <p>Equus Caballus 9000 or in layman's terms "Horse 9000" is our high end state of the art horse bread for pure, raw, and unadulterated speed. Equiped with rocket thrusters for extra speed a steering wheel to control said speed, because normal horse reins would never be enough to control the incredible speed that Horse 9000 can achieve. And finally Horse 9000 is equiped with state of the art lazer vision for faster reaction time so that his incredible speed can be used at full power. But a horse like this comes with a price, a large price of 10,000 dollars. </p>
